Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
This app is meant to help team managers to make a html page that will be populated with their team members contact information in one convenient location. My motivation for this project was to become more familiar with npm packages like jest(for testing) and inquirer(for prompting questions).  

I learned how to make failing test and to pass them, as well as making classes and subclasses

## Installation

npm i inquirer
npm i jest
## Usage

## Credits
Many thanks for office hours, my tutor, and my classmate Jun, for leading me to the right track
