# team-profile-generator


## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
This app is meant to help team managers to make a html page that will be populated with their team members contact information in one convenient location. My motivation for this project was to become more familiar with npm packages like jest(for testing) and inquirer(for prompting questions).  

As of right now, my app can only have 1 manager, 1 engineer and 1 intern. I plan to add the functionality of being able to add more team members.

Overall, this definetly was one of the hardest assignments to date. However, I did learn how to make failing test and to pass them, as well as making classes and subclasses

## Installation
npm init
npm i inquirer
npm i jest
## Usage
Here is a quick video of how to use my app:
